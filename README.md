# EganSchofield_ENV872_FinalProject
The purpose of this project is to analyze river data collected from the non-profit, Science on the Fly. As river temperature changes, how does the sample chemistry change as well?

Over the last year, Ben Egan, has worked with a non-profit, Science on the Fly. The non profit crowd sources river data from fly fishermen all over the country. Although the project is relatively new, they have had several years of testing and several sites on the Childs River in Massachusetts.=
